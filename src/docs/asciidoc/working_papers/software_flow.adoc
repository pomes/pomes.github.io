This article will focus on the delivery of a software system from a developer's local environment through to
its deployment and ongoing maintenance. The use of Open Source Software (OSS) within the software supply chain will be
a primary interest area.

== Introduction

When considering an assembly line we often conjure the image of a car or plane "factory" in which people and robots
work to bring together a tangible product. Behind the assembly line is an array of primary and secondary suppliers that
produce the components that are included in the final product - think here about seats, wheels, computer chips, wires,
steel, windows (glass) etc. The act of bringing together a car on the assembly line is only a small proportion of the
activities that are needed to produce the final product.

For most non-trivial contemporary application development projects, the software developed by the project team will draw
on a range of components in order to produce a software system. As I'll describe in this article, the team will utilise
a variety of third-party technologies that perform a variety of functions either in the end product or in its assembly.

TIP: Naturally, a project team could write their solution from scratch and not include any third-party components. However, the
work undertaken will generally use operating systems and software platforms that were not written by the team.

In the diagram below I have attempted to capture key elements across the flow of going from writing code (developing)
through to the deployment of the system into one or more environments.

A set of facets are highlighted in the diagram:

Local development environment:: each developer (or pair of developers) will produce code on a local machine

Central build environment:: a suite of platforms and tools that store, build, test otherwise prepare code for deployment

Deployment environment:: one or more environments into which the software system will be deployed for operation

Package repositories:: house a variety of software packages for use by various aspects of the other facets

I'll start with a general discssion of cross-cutting concerns and then explore general aspects of each facet. My goal
is to use this article as a foundation for further work and I will provide links (as appropriate) to further content by myself
and others in a hope to provide a range of information (coarse- to fine-grained) across the activity of developing software systems.

====
The discussion will centre on elements of construction, testing, maintenance, configuration managment, and engineering management.
Aspects of design will be considered but the discussion will focus on general concepts.

A number of aspects pertaining to the field of software engineering are not directly discussed: requirements and models & methods.

=== Package repositories

==== Language-based repositories

==== Operating system repositories

Most operating system (OS) distributions utilise a package manager that is used to install, update and remove
packages. Examples of

|===
|Operating system |OS Distribution |Package manager |Package format
| Linux           |Debian          |dpkg            |deb
|===

Some projects will package their software system in an OS package format that suits the OS distribution provided in the
destination deployment environment.
