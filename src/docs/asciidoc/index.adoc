image::images/pomes.png[The Pomes logo - a pomegranate,150,150]

The outer view of a pomegranate is one of intriguing form - a variety range of colours, some roughness to
the texture, and a little "crown" at the base.

Within the fruit is a spongy structure that grasps the
numerous seeds. These seeds are coated by a sweet membrane.

To me, the whole structure seemed an apt icon for discussing software systems.
